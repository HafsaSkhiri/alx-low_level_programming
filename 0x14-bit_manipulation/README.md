BIT MANIPULATION

Bit manipulation in C involves manipulating individual bits or groups of bits within a binary representation of data. This can be useful for various purposes such as optimization, encryption, and data compression.

In C, bit manipulation is achieved using bitwise operators. These operators work at the level of individual bits, allowing you to perform operations such as setting, clearing, flipping, or testing the value of a particular bit.

The bitwise operators available in C are:

1. & (bitwise AND)
2. | (bitwise OR)
3. ^ (bitwise XOR)
4. ~ (bitwise complement)
5. << (left shift)
(right shift)
